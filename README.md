# Capstone - Travel App

## Overview
This project aims to combine all skills learned in the previous projects to build our own custom travel app. This app allows the user to fill in a travel destination and traveling dates. Upon page load the app will display the current weahter from the users location. Upon submit the app will display a background image of the travel destination and a weather forecast of the destination depending of how far in advance the travel plans are. If the user is traveling within a week the forecast will be of this week starting with their arrival day. If the trip is later the current weather will be displayed.
I choose the following options from the Extend your Project/Ways to Stand Out sections:

* Add end date and display length of trip.
* Incorporate icons into forecast.
* Instead of just pulling a single day forecast, pull the forecast for multiple days.
* And I've added the current weather at the users location upon page load.  


## Instructions
This will require a understanding of JavaScript, create clean and appealing HTML/CSS, targeting the DOM, working with objects and retrieving data from 3 APIs in which one of those is reliant on another to work. Finally this is all going to be done in a Webpack environment, using an express server and wrapped up with service workers.

### Tools used

* HTML
* SCSS
* Javascript
* Node
* Express
* GeoNames API
* WeatherBit API
* PixaBay API
* Jest
* Workbox

## Installation

### 1 Getting Started

Make sure Node and npm are installed from the terminal.

node -v
npm -v

Fork this repo and clone to begin your project setup and install everything: 

`cd` <project directory>
`npm install`

Install the following loaders and plugins

- npm i -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader
- npm i -D style-loader node-sass css-loader sass-loader
- npm i -D clean-webpack-plugin
- npm i -D html-webpack-plugin
- npm i -D mini-css-extract-plugin
- npm i -D optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin terser-webpack-plugin

### 2 Setting up the API

Sign up for the API-key's at geonames.org  weatherbit.io   pixabay.com

You'll need to configure environment variables using the dotenv package:

Use npm to install the dotenv package - npm install dotenv

Create a new .env file in the root of your project.

Fill the .env file with your weatherbit API key like this:

API_KEY=**************************

### 3 Setup service workers for offline functionality

Require the plugin, by appending the new plugin statement in your webpack.prod.js file.

const WorkboxPlugin = require('workbox-webpack-plugin')

Instantiate the new plugin in the plugin list.

    plugins: [
        new WorkboxPlugin.GenerateSW(),
    ]

use npm to install the plugin:

npm install workbox-webpack-plugin --save-dev

### 4 Run the app
npm run build : builds project

npm start : Run project

The app opens on localhost 3000.

The server listens on port 3030.

To run Jest Test on the server 'comment out' the Setup Server part of server.js

and run: npm run test



## Known issues
There is a compatibility issue with the terser plugin. The plugin needs to be downgrade in the package.json file to

 > "terser-webpack-plugin": "^4.2.3"

 Then run

  - npm i
  - npm run build-prod
