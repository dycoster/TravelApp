# Capstone - Travel App

## Overview
This project aims to combine all skills learned in the previous projects to build our own custom travel app.

## Instructions
This will require a solid understanding of JavaScript, create clean and appealing HTML/CSS, targeting the DOM, working with objects and retrieving data from 3 APIs in which one of those is reliant on another to work. Finally this is all going to be done in a Webpack environment, using an express server and wrapped up with service workers.
